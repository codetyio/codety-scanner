**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask or submit the
issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best
effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change
something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of
rules to get in the way of that.

That said, if you want to ensure that a pull request is likely to be merged,
talk to us! A great way to do this is in issues themselves. When you want to
work on an issue, comment on it first and tell us the approach you want to take.

## Getting Started

### Some Ways to Contribute

* Report potential bugs.
* Suggest product enhancements.
* Increase our test coverage.
* Fix bugs.
* Improve our guides and documentation.
* Respond to questions about usage on the issue tracker.

### Reporting an Issue

>Note: Issues on GitHub for Codety Scanner are intended to be related to bugs or feature requests.
>Questions should be directed to other community resources.

* Make sure you test against the latest released version. It is possible we
  already fixed the bug you're experiencing. However, if you are on an older
  version of Codety Scanner and feel the issue is critical, do let us know.

* Check existing issues (both open and closed) to make sure it has not been
  reported previously.

* Provide a reproducible test case. If a contributor can't reproduce an issue,
  then it dramatically lowers the chances it'll get fixed.

* Aim to respond promptly to any questions made by the Codety team on your
  issue. Stale issues will be closed.

### Issue Lifecycle

1. The issue is reported.

2. The issue is verified and categorized by a Codety Scanner maintainer.
   Categorization is done via tags. For example, bugs are tagged as "bug".

3. Unless it is critical, the issue is left for a period of time (sometimes many
   weeks), giving outside contributors a chance to address the issue.

4. The issue is addressed in a pull request or commit. The issue will be
   referenced in the commit message so that the code that fixes it is clearly
   linked. Any change a Codety Scanner user might need to know about will include a
   changelog entry in the PR.

5. The issue is closed.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before writing any code, we recommend:
- Create a Github issue if none already exists for the code change you'd like to make.
- Write a comment on the Github issue indicating you're interested in contributing so
  maintainers can provide their perspective if needed.

Keep your pull requests (PRs) small and open them early so you can get feedback on
approach from maintainers before investing your time in larger changes. 

### Backport Policy

Codety Scanner is maintained as a Community Edition (CE) and an Enterprise product. Bug fixes and patches may be backported to the current major release in CE. In Enterprise, bug fixes and patches may be backported to all maintained releases: the N-2 releases and the 2 latest Long-Term Support (LTS) releases.
